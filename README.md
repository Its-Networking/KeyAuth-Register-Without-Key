!!! THIS USES YOUR SELLER KEY! YOU MUST HAVE SELLER IN ORDER TO USE THIS SETUP!!! It's $19.99/YR - MAKE SURE YOU PROTECT YOUR CODE SINCE YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH A SELLER KEY!!!

This will allow you to let users register on your application without entering a key. Go through Form1.cs to see how it's setup... it's really easy.
However, if you are having issues just let me know (IT'S ɴᴇᴛᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ#6912).

Pros:
Easily allow users to register without having a key

Cons: 
Can not set custom expiration date for different users,
Can not set custom level for different users,


You can manually edit the mass, level, and expiration. But that output will be given to every member that registers on your application.


This was requested by someone, so I made it... if you want to see something created just let me know.
